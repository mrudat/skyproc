# Reporting Bugs
## I need and love your bug reports.
It is my goal to make SUM the best it can be, and to do so I need your feedback! If you have an issue, please contact me so we can get it straightened out.

That being said, most issues will have to do with one of the patchers you're running, rather than with SUM itself. You will have to take those issues to the mod authors themselves.

If you have found a bug with SUM itself, please submit a bug report and get into contact with me.

## To submit a bug report
1. Please zip up the `SkyProc Debug/` folder after triggering the issue.
2. Send it to Afterimage1753@gmail.com, describing the context and issue encountered. If you've made a post, please include your username so I can associate the two.
